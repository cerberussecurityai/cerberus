# Cerberus Flex Gateway Custom Policy

A MuleSoft Flex Gateway custom policy (Rust → WASM, built with the PDK)
that captures HTTP request metadata, sanitizes PII, and ships events to
the Cerberus backend.

## Status: **scaffold (v1)**

The Rust source compiles with PDK 1.8.0 (`make build` requires the
toolchain — see [Setup](#setup) below). The shipped policy provides:

- Request metadata capture (header / query / body sanitization, IP
  normalization + HMAC, source IP resolution, health-endpoint filter).
- Path scoping via `capturePaths` / `excludePaths` globs.
- Per-worker bounded queue with drop-on-full counter.
- Batched outbound POST to the Cerberus backend every `flushIntervalMs`.
- Init-time HMAC secret fetch with 5-second timeout.

### Known gaps in v1

| Gap | Why |
|---|---|
| `_cerberus_metrics` extraction (response body inspection) | Mutating response bodies interacts badly with `Content-Length` / `Content-Encoding` / streaming bodies / response signing. Customers who set `_cerberus_metrics` already install at the application layer. |
| Retry / backoff on backend failures | Currently at-most-once: failed batches are dropped. |
| Circuit breaker for sustained backend outages | Without one, every flush during an outage posts into a black hole. Currently logs and moves on. |
| Policy-side observability (queue depth, drop rate, ingest-failure rate) | Currently surfaces `dropped` count via `logger::warn!` only. |
| `status_code` / `latency_ms` capture | Trivially addable in `response_filter`. |
| Streaming-body capture for >1MB JSON payloads | PDK's default `into_body_state()` caps at 1MB. Currently silently truncated/dropped for large payloads. |
| Graceful shutdown / drain | proxy-wasm has no `on_drain` hook. Up to ~`flushIntervalMs` of buffered events are lost on every pod churn (rolling deploy, OOM, scale-down). Documented and accepted. |

## Configuration (`gcl.yaml`)

| Property | Required | Default | Purpose |
|---|:---:|---|---|
| `ingestService` | ✓ | — | Cerberus backend URL. The policy POSTs to `<ingestService>/v1/ingest/batch`. |
| `token` | ✓ | — | Cerberus API key. Sent as the `X-API-Key` header on outbound requests. Trimmed at config-parse time. |
| `secretKey` | | — | HMAC key for PII hashing. Inline alternative to `backendUrl`. |
| `backendUrl` | | — | Base URL to fetch HMAC key from at startup. 5-second timeout; failure logs and falls back to raw PII. Use `https://` in production. |
| `clientIpHeader` | | `X-Forwarded-For` | Header to read the client IP from (first hop). Falls back to Envoy connection source if absent. |
| `userIdHeader` | | unset | Header to read end-user identity from (e.g. `X-User-Id`). Required for per-end-user analytics; intentionally not defaulted so each deployment picks its own header. |
| `capturePaths` | | `[]` | Glob allowlist. Empty = capture everything. Primary lever for high-RPS scoping. |
| `excludePaths` | | `[]` | Glob denylist. Wins over `capturePaths` on overlap. |
| `captureRequestBody` | | `true` | Buffer + sanitize JSON request bodies (POST/PUT/PATCH only). Disable globally to skip the buffering cost; for per-route scoping use `capturePaths` / `excludePaths`. |
| `batchSize` | | `50` | Events per outbound POST (max 1000 — server-side cap). |
| `flushIntervalMs` | | `2000` | Flush cadence. Min 100ms (prevents tight-loop misconfig). |
| `queueCapacity` | | `10000` | Per-worker queue. Total memory ~ `workers × queueCapacity × ~5KB`. |
| `logLevel` | | `info` | One of: `debug`, `info`, `warn`, `error`. |

### Header semantics

Envoy presents headers as `(name, value)` pairs with name lowercased per
HTTP/2 conventions, and multi-valued headers (e.g. `Set-Cookie`,
comma-folded `X-Forwarded-For`) appear as multiple entries with the
same name. The policy:

1. Title-cases header names (`x-api-key` → `X-Api-Key`).
2. Collapses multi-valued headers with `, ` separator before storing
   in the event payload.

### Path scoping

`capturePaths` / `excludePaths` use `globset` syntax:

- `*` matches one path segment (no slashes).
- `**` matches any number of segments.
- Patterns are exact-match — trailing slashes matter. Add both
  variants if you want to capture both forms.

Example: scope to public-API endpoints, exclude internal admin paths.

```yaml
capturePaths:
  - "/api/v1/**"
  - "/api/v2/**"
excludePaths:
  - "/api/v*/admin/**"
```

Health endpoints (`/health`, `/health_check`, `/ready`) are always
skipped regardless of filter config.

## Setup

Prerequisites (PDK 1.8.0, April 2026):

```bash
# Rust toolchain
rustup target add wasm32-wasip1

# Anypoint CLI + PDK plugin
npm install -g anypoint-cli-v4
anypoint-cli-v4 plugins:install anypoint-pdk-plugin

# Anypoint cargo extensions (build / publish helpers)
cargo install --locked cargo-anypoint cargo-llvm-cov

# Sync parity fixtures (creates tests/fixtures -> ../parity-fixtures)
make sync-fixtures
```

## Build / test

```bash
make build   # compile to wasm32-wasip1; emits target/wasm32-wasip1/release/cerberus-flex-gateway.wasm
make test    # cargo test (parity + unit)
make run     # boots a local Flex Gateway in Docker Compose with the policy attached
```

`make sync-fixtures` is required before `make test` if you've never
run it — the parity test runner reads from `tests/fixtures/`, which is
a symlink to the repo-root `parity-fixtures/` directory.

## Deployment

Two operator-facing modes are supported in v1.

### Local mode (development + air-gapped operators)

1. `make build` → produces `bin/cerberus_flex_gateway.wasm` and the GCL
   manifests.
2. Copy `.wasm` and `gcl.yaml` onto every Flex Gateway pod (via
   ConfigMap / volume mount).
3. Apply a `PolicyBinding` CR scoped to your API instance with the
   policy's config values.
4. Verify with `kubectl logs` — should see policy `configure` log
   lines and a successful secret-key fetch (if `backendUrl` is set).

<https://docs.mulesoft.com/gateway/latest/flex-local-deploy-custom-policy>.

### Connected mode (Anypoint Exchange + API Manager)

1. `make publish` once per dev iteration → pushes a `*-dev` Exchange
   asset (mutable). Set `[package.metadata.anypoint]` IDs in
   `Cargo.toml` first.
2. `make release` once stable → pushes an immutable Exchange release.
3. Apply via API Manager UI (Custom tab → select policy → fill the
   form rendered from `gcl.yaml`) or via CLI:
   ```
   anypoint-cli-v4 api-mgr policy apply \
     --apiInstanceId <id> \
     --policyId <exchange-asset-id> \
     --config '{"ingestService":"...","token":"..."}'
   ```
4. Verify in API Manager + gateway pod logs.

## Verification end-to-end

```bash
# Drive traffic
curl -X POST https://your-flex-gateway/api/v1/users \
     -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
     -d '{"username": "alice", "password": "hunter2"}'

# Verify the event landed in the Cerberus dashboard for your client_id.
```

The `Authorization` header value should be either `[REDACTED]` (no
secret configured) or a 64-char lowercase hex digest (HMAC-SHA256).
The body should have `password` replaced by `[REDACTED]`.

## Parity testing

The crate duplicates `SENSITIVE_KEYS` / `SENSITIVE_HEADERS` /
`REDACTED` and reimplements `sanitize_dict` / `normalize_ip` /
`hash_pii` so the WASM target has no Python dependency. The Cerberus
implementations all consume the same YAML fixtures from
`../parity-fixtures/`:

- `cerberus-django/tests/test_parity.py` runs them against `cerberus_core`.
- `cerberus-flex-gateway/tests/parity_runner.rs` runs them against the
  Rust ports.

If you change a constant in `cerberus-core/src/cerberus_core/sanitization.py`,
update the fixture file in the **same PR** so the other implementations
are forced to follow.
